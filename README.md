## Description
Lorem is a demo application based on modern Android application tech-stacks and MVVM architecture.
Fetching data from the network and integrating persisted data in the database via repository pattern.

## Quick start
This is a normal lorem app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://google.com).
This project uses **Lorem** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://google.com/).
And also on this project uses **Modularization** approach to separate each feature ([core](https://google.com), [shared](https://google.com), [ui](https://google.com) modules).
You can do self-study about it in [here](https://google.com).

    # Root Project
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ lorem                   # Name of module (new package)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lorem               # Business logic component.
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lorem            # Remote Data Handlers
    |       â”œâ”€â”€ lorem            # Retrofit API for remote end point, model using Equatable.
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ lorem     # Single source of data and for handling data from network to cache.

    â”œâ”€â”€ lorem                    # Name of module (default from lorem)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lorem                 # Activity/View layer

        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lorem        # Custom function, extension, etc which can be used repeatedly on each method.
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lorem         # Custom style that will be used on each widget.
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lorem          # Utility classes.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based + [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) for asynchronous.
- JetPack
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Room Persistence - construct a database using the abstract layer.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - View Binding - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository pattern
  - Clean Architecture
  - Modularization
- [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) - dependency injection.
